          <p>
            My name is Younes Ziewki and I graduated from James Madison
            University in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Business Administration in
            Computer Information Systems. I'm excited to pursue a career in the
            field of technology. I have a strong interest in technology and a
            passion for using my skills to help organizations achieve their
            goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            Throughout my studies, I have gained a solid understanding of
            programming, business/system analysis, database systems, and
            software development methodologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Throughout my academic career, I have honed my abilities in working
            seamlessly within team environments. I thrive on collaboration and
            have actively contributed to numerous projects, fostering strong
            communication skills along the way. With experience in Agile
            methodologies, I am well-versed in adapting to dynamic work
            environments and delivering results efficiently.
            <br />
            <br />
            My personal qualities, such as my attention to detail,
            problem-solving abilities, and eagerness to learn and grow, make me
            thrive in any professional environment. I am confident that I can
            flourish in a fast-paced, collaborative environment and make
            meaningful contributions to a team.

              Information Systems Development and Implementation Capstone
              Project
            </h1>
            <p>
              Here, I am excited to share the details of my Computer Information
              Systems senior capstone project. Working with a talented team of
              ten individuals, including back-end and front-end developers,
              database developers, UX/UI designers, and a system analyst, we
              created an innovative office hours management system for James
              Madison University.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our project aimed to streamline the scheduling and management of
              office hours between professors and students. We developed a
              user-friendly platform that allowed professors to upload their
              office hours, while students could easily sign up for available
              slots. The system placed students in a queue, providing them with
              their queue number and estimated waiting time.
              <br />
              <br />
              To enhance the user experience, we incorporated features such as
              the ability for students to view their queue number, cancel
              appointments, and perform other tasks for flexibility. Professors
              had access to analytics that enabled them to monitor the number of
              students in the queue and gain insights into their availability.
              <br />
              <br />
              As the front-end/database developer, my role involved ensuring the
              website was fully functional and user-friendly. I utilized HTML,
              CSS, and SQL to create an intuitive interface, collaborating
              closely with the UX/UI designers to deliver a visually appealing
              website that met the needs of our users. This project allowed me
              to enhance my technical skills in front-end development and
              database management. It also reinforced my ability to work
              effectively in a team, emphasizing the importance of clear
              communication and efficient collaboration.
              <br />
              <br />
              This capstone project provided me with real-world experience in
              developing a practical solution to a common problem faced by both
              professors and students. It allowed me to combine my technical
              knowledge with creativity and problem-solving abilities, resulting
              in a tangible and impactful product. The project not only deepened
              my understanding of computer information systems but also fostered
              a passion for creating solutions that optimize efficiency and
              improve user experiences.
